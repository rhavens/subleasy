	<div class='ui item'>
		<p>Subleasy simplifies this process in a number of ways. All posted sublets are displayed on a map so various offers can be compared at the same time based on location, rent, and dates available. Click on a sublet to view even more details such as photo and description.</p>
		<p>When you find one you like, click "Contact Seller" and send them a message! Start the conversation.</p>
		<p>All sublets posted on Subleasy are classified as negotiable and the final agreement must be worked out between the subletter and the subletting party.</p>
